## Demo

When instantiating the faker, it already gives you a paragraph, a sentence and a single word, but you can generate a new one by calling them as methods (see below)

```php
  $faker = Baueri\LorumIpse\LorumIpseFaker::make();
```

**Getting a paragraph**

```php
  echo $faker->paragraph;

  //Calling as method. You can set the number of sentences you want to retrieve
  echo $faker->paragraph(4);
```

**Getting a sentence with specific number of words**

```php
  echo $faker->sentence;
  
  //Calling as method, setting number of words as parameter
  echo $faker->sentence(10);
```

**Get a single random word**

```php
  echo $faker->word;

  //or with a function (this generates a new word)
  echo $faker->word();
```
